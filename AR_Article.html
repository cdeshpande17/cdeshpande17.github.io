          <p class="lead animate-this" style="color:white" style="padding-right: 5px">Apple officially entered the Augmented reality game in early 2017 with the release of ARKit, their augmented reality development platform. It was intended as a toolkit of sorts for developers who wanted to start incorporating AR into their iOS apps. The platform gave developers structural support for their AR features, which they could build upon as they see fit, without having to worry about a lot of the problems AR developers face when building something out from scratch. This initial foray into AR was interesting, but it wasn’t clear how serious Apple was about entering the industry. Then, when Apple released the iPhone 8, iPhone 8+, and the iPhone X later the same year, each phone with more accurate and powerful motion capture and gyroscopic capabilities, their message was quite clear: AR is here to stay. But while the initial tools and applications created through ARKit were cool, and definitely had a certain “wow factor,” they really did not deliver the game changing technological revolution some had expected. To be fair, some apps were quite useful, such as Ikea Place, which allowed users to see the furniture they were picking in the context of their room through the camera before they bought them. However, many others, such as Skyguide AR, while nifty, were clearly meant to be nothing more than gimmicks. However, the recent release of ARKit 2.0 at WWDC 2018, shows that augmented reality is a huge part of Apple’s plans for their future. <br /><br/>

So what are the actual advantages of ARKit? For a start, ARKit does a lot of the work on behalf of developers, analyzing an environment and locating horizontal planes suitable to place virtual objects, while also keeping track of the location of these planes when they moved out of view of the rear camera. It is also capable of monitoring the lighting of the environment, which could then be used on objects within the AR view to make them appear to be more "real" in a scene. Additionally, ARKit uses mostly CoreMotion data, meaning it relies on very basic motion tracking and gyroscopic technologies and is able to work only using a single rear camera, without any accessories or add-ons. These are relatively low hardware requirements, making ARKit apps vastly compatible with pretty much any device running a recent version of iOS. This is one thing that did not change with ARKit 2, as the new platform is also compatible with a huge range of iOS devices. This gives developers a very large target audience and allows AR applications to reach even more people. ARKit 2 brought many improvements to the original which really broadened the things developers can do with the platform. Some of the biggest improvements include improved face tracking, 3D object detection, persistent experiences and shared experiences. Improved facial tracking is important for Apple because of the release of the iPhone X, which included technology that could map and read your face. ARKit 2’s improved facial tracking allows developers to harness this technology to create more accurate and realistic Face-Based AR experiences. 3D object detection is a huge new feature. In the original version of ARKit, the platform detected flat rectangular objects to map the room, and then used that to create the AR experience. It worked, but limited how applications interacted with the world, and sometimes caused problems in environments which were made up of complex structures. ARKit 2 lets developers fully detect 3D objects, use them to map the room, and create applications that interact with these 3D objects. This new feature is huge because it removes one of the biggest limitations of the original ARKit, and allows developers to create a more accurate and immersive user experience. And finally, persistent and shared experiences, which are features that are extremely valuable for game developers. Persistent experiences mean that AR spaces and objects linked to objects in the physical world can be saved and brought up exactly where you left off later. Shared experiences allows multiple users on multiple devices to view the same AR environment. These features allow game developers to create levels and checkpoints in their games that the user can return to after exiting, while shared experiences opens up a whole new genre of mobile gaming: multiplayer augmented reality. To show some of the potential of this new feature Apple demoed a block-breaking multiplayer game, and Lego demonstrated how 4 players can interact with the same environment on their application at once. <br /><br />

ARKit 2 represents the augmented reality experience we hoped for when the rumor of Apple entering the industry were originally published in 2016. It truly gives AR developers a powerful and capable platform on which to build countless fun, revolutionary, and above all, useful applications. It has also inspired other companies to release similar platforms such as AR Core from Google, and Mixed Reality from Microsoft. Even Facebook has pledged to focus more on the space. This push from the industry towards AR can be traced back to the release of the original ARKit, and has only intensified with ARKit 2. The technology revolution we were promised is finally upon us, and ARKit is leading the way.
